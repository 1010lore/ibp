      IBP is the <strong>Interactive Branch Predictor</strong>. It simulates a
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor#Global_branch_prediction"
        >global history correlating branch predictor</a
      >
      that consists of multiple prediction tables indexed by a shift register
      that tracks branch history. The branch prediction mechanism is described
      in more detail
      <a href="https://1010labs.org/~ajaymt/branch-predictors">here</a>; this
      document is an overview of the IBP interface.

      <h1 id="interface">Interface</h1>
      <div><img src="interface.webp" style="max-height: 500px" /></div>
      <div>
        The IBP interface consists of the <strong>Program</strong> View,
        <strong>Branch Predictor</strong> View and
        <strong>Accuracy</strong> View.
      </div>
      <div>
        Program syntax and semantics are described in the
        <a href="#program_language">Program Language</a> section below. The
        Program View displays editable program text and highlights the next
        statement to be executed. The "Compile" button checks the validity of
        the program and enables execution.
      </div>
      <div>
        The Branch Predictor View displays the current iteration and the state
        of the branch predictor.
        <ul>
          <li>
            The "Step" button executes a statement and advances to the next
            statement or iteration.
          </li>
          <li>The "Run" button runs the specified number of iterations.</li>
          <li>
            The "Reset" button resets the current iteration and the state of the
            branch predictor.
          </li>
          <li>
            The "Update" button changes the parameters of the predictor as
            specified and resets its state.
          </li>
        </ul>
        The Predictor View displays the current predictor table as selected by
        the shift register and highlights the corresponding table entry if the
        next statement is a conditional branch (if), as well as the current PC
        and the result of the last prediction. The PC of each statement is its
        <em>line number</em> displayed in the editor.
      </div>
      <div>
        The Accuracy view displays the accuracy of the branch predictor. The
        "Reset" button resets the accuracy and the count of
        branches/predictions.
      </div>

      <h1 id="program_language">Program Language</h1>
      <div>
        The IBP Program Language is syntactically and semantically very similar
        to C:
      </div>
      <pre class="box"><code>let a = 1;
if (a < 2) {
  let b = rand(12);
  let c = b << 2;
  if (c > b) {}
}</code></pre>
      <div>
        A single program is a list of statements. Statements can be of two
        forms:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <code>let &lt;identifier&gt; = &lt;expression&gt;;</code><br />
            "Let" statements bind the identifier to the result of the expression
            within the current scope. Identifiers must begin with an alphabet or
            underscore and be followed by zero or more alphabets, underscores or
            digits.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <code>if (&lt;expression&gt;) { [&lt;statement&gt;] }</code><br />
            "If" statements are the branches that are predicted. As in C,
            conditional expressions that evaluate to zero are treated as false
            and non-zero values are treated as true. The branch is considered
            <strong>taken</strong> when the condition is true and is
            <strong>not taken</strong> when the condition is false. The
            statements in the "body" of the if statement execute within a new
            scope that inherits the variables defined in its parent scope.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        Expressions can be one of:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Number literals:</strong> These are decimal integer
            literals, or hexadecimal, octal or binary integer literals prefixed
            with <code>0x</code>, <code>0o</code> and
            <code>0b</code> respectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Variables:</strong> These are identifiers that are bound to
            a value in the current scope or a parent scope. The variable
            <code>i</code> is defined implicitly and is the loop counter.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Unary or binary operations:</strong> These operate on one or
            two expressions respectively. The IBP Program Language has the same
            set of operators as
            <a
              href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/operator_precedence"
              >C and C++</a
            >
            with the same precedence, with the exception of the ternary
            (<code>?:</code>), assignment (<code>+=, -=, *=</code> etc.) and
            increment/decrement (<code>++, --</code>) operators.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Random numbers:</strong> The built-in
            <code>rand(n)</code> "function" produces a random integer between
            zero and <code>n</code> (inclusive) where <code>n</code> is any
            expression.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        Notably, every expression evaluates to a <strong>number</strong>. This
        is a JavaScript number and not an integer, which means division is not
        floored: <code>1 / 2</code> is 0.5 and not 0.
      </div>
      <div>
        The entire language is specified in
        <a href="program.pegjs">this PEG file</a>.
